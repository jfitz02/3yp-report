@JoDonnaSaunder2 Bullshit! There’s zero proof. You people throw around disgusting accusations about Meghan but can’t prove any of it. 1621204854759636996
@ExoAcademian You have to hold the history of the phenomenon, the truth of consciousness and reality, the political and secret-societal shenanigans, human origins, etc. in mind. Not easy to paint a full picture! 1621207669641035779

@gossmata58 That’s the thing-  people get down when a coach leaves, a player transfers/graduates, we lose a big game, etc- but it’s a marathon not a sprint.  UC might have a down period, but it never lasts long.  The school values sports and we have the resources to quickly correct things. 1621208971926274051
@jordanbpeterson Broad public?  Or only those you recognize as “normal”…alpha male and beta female participants only, committed to a monogamous, heterosexual marriage?  Based on an assumption that anything counter culture must be globalist.  What “weight” is given to developing countries? 1621193988677025792

@9thEvermore @gopTODD Exactly, Todd, what if someone gave you a raise, but as part of that raise, it also somehow helped the average people, or marginalized communities, something your party is fundamentally opposed to. 1621204962087960576

@77MJones @Jimmywonton2 @MorgenDugg7 The being paid back part is taking the house and selling it for huge profits and not giving a dime back to the now deposed homeowner.  I hear that's freedom. 1621134396198641664

@RobertJThomas1 @tedcruz It’s obvious that folks like you don’t care about the people in Texas who need healthcare. Cruz has voted several times to repeal Obamacare. In fact, @GOP Republicans attempted 63 times to repeal Obamacare. Thanks to a war hero, McCain, the coward Trump wasn’t able to succeed. 1621205417937473536

@matinyarare It's self contravention to postulate regime change  in SA where whites are already controlling 85% industrial stake.Look for actual factors at play rather than infiltrate regime change propaganda, it doesn't make sense in south Africa's case 1621205426338422791

@MTOFNern @DontMessettUp @modelolover_ @216BaseballPod My favorite fan is the "Don't critique the front office or players ever" fan. We haven't won a World Series in 75 years. I think a little light criticism and even some sarcasm is warranted 1621208140745154566
