  title={Media Bias Monitor: Quantifying Biases of Social Media News Outlets at Large-Scale},
  volume={12},

  abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; As Internet users increasingly rely on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to receive news, they are faced with a bewildering number of news media choices. For example, thousands of Facebook pages today are registered and categorized as some form of news media outlets. Inferring the bias (or slant) of these media pages poses a difficult challenge for media watchdog organizations that traditionally rely on content analysis. In this paper, we explore a novel scalable methodology to accurately infer the biases of thousands of news sources on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. Our key idea is to utilize their advertiser interfaces, that offer detailed insights into the demographics of the news source’s audience on the social media site. We show that the ideological (liberal or conservative) leaning of a news source can be accurately estimated by the extent to which liberals or conservatives are over-/under-represented among its audience. Additionally, we show how biases in a news source’s audience demographics, along the lines of race, gender, age, national identity, and income, can be used to infer more fine-grained biases of the source, such as social vs. economic vs. nationalistic conservatism. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach by building and publicly deploying a system, called &quot;Media Bias Monitor&quot;, which makes the biases in audience demographics for over 20,000 news outlets on Facebook transparent to any Internet user. &lt;/p&gt; },

  abstract={Users frequently use search systems on the Web as well as online social media to learn about ongoing events and public opinion on personalities. Prior studies have shown that the top-ranked results returned by these search engines can shape user opinion about the topic (e.g., event or person) being searched. In case of polarizing topics like politics, where multiple competing perspectives exist, the political bias in the top search results can play a significant role in shaping public opinion towards (or away from) certain perspectives. Given the considerable impact that search bias can have on the user, we propose a generalizable search bias quantification framework that not only measures the political bias in ranked list output by the search system but also decouples the bias introduced by the different sources---input data and ranking system. We apply our framework to study the political bias in searches related to 2016 US Presidential primaries in Twitter social media search and find that both input data and ranking system matter in determining the final search output bias seen by the users. And finally, we use the framework to compare the relative bias for two popular search systems---Twitter social media search and Google web search---for queries related to politicians and political events. We end by discussing some potential solutions to signal the bias in the search results to make the users more aware of them.},

  title={Quantifying Political Leaning from Tweets and Retweets},
  volume={7},
  url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14422},
  abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; Media outlets and pundits have been quick to embrace online social networks to disseminate their own opinions. But pundits’ opinions and news coverage are often marked by a clear political bias, as widely evidenced during the fiercely contested&lt;br /&gt;2012 U.S. presidential elections. Given the wide availability of such data from sites like Twitter, a natural question is whether we can quantify the political leanings of media outlets using OSN data. In this work, by drawing a correspondence between tweeting and retweeting behavior, we formulate political leaning estimation as an ill-posed linear inverse problem. The result is a simple and scalable approach that does not require explicit knowledge of the network topology. We evaluate our method with a dataset of 119 million election-related tweets collected from April to November, and use it to study the political leaning of prominent tweeters and media sources. &lt;/p&gt; },
