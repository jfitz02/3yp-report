Test 1 - CONTROL
Create twitter account(s)
Analyze top x posts
This will be our baseline

Test 2 - Feedback Velocity
Create 4 social media accounts.
Pick a topic label
RULE = perform {action} if model outputs label
action = 
    1. DO NOTHING
    2. LIKE
    3. SHARE
    4. LIKE & SHARE
This allows us to apply a form of feedback loop between our model and the recommender system.
Hypotheses: actions 1,2,3 should move towards a value representative of the chosen topic
            action 4 should move randomly
            action 4 should move faster than action 3 or 2.
            action 2 and 3 should move at a similar pace.

Test 3 - Following Affect
Create x social media accounts that follow mutually exclusive set of accounts (respective of certain topics)
Analyze what topics these accounts are shown
Hypotheses: Say an account follows BBC news, a set of politicians and ITV news, we would expect to see a lot of news/politics/disasters
            Say an account follows a set of footballers, we expect to see sport/politics.

Test 4 - Recommender Affect
Create a social media account that follows a set of similar accounts
Analyze the tweets in feed, and compare to the tweets of the accounts
We are seeing what bias is given by the recommender system and not the user
Hypotheses: The results will not be equal, due to the recommender system possibly trying to display more content.

Test 5 - Random Movement
similar to test 2.
We set up 4 accounts
    1. DOES NOTHING
    2. LIKES EVERYTHING
    3. SHARES EVERYTHING
    4. LIKES AND SHARES EVERYTHING

hypotheses: The values will tend to an extreme of an echo chamber based off its original set of tweets.
    1. Should move slowest
    4. Should move fastest.
            They may all end up in different echo chambers, but we expect a convergence (temporarily).

Test 6 - My personal account
I will create a new twitter account and analyze how the topics represented change through my normal use of social media
hypotheses: Meat and F1

Test 7 - The ELON effect (Joke test)
This test is aimed at identifying whether ELON is forcing his posts onto other users.
Set up a twitter account, follow numerous accounts (except ELON).
Upon analysis, count number of tweets from ELON as a percentage.
Compare this to how many posts we expect to see (0?)
Hypotheses: ELON is forcing his opinions on us

Test 8 - Who are they?
This test will identify how many posts are shown to us of of accounts we do not follow
This also means, no one the account follows can retweet/like/comment on said post
Set up x accounts. All with an increasing number of followings (say: 5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 100, 200)
Identify percentage of unrelated posts

Test 9 - escaping echo chamber
This test aims to see how hard it is to exit and echo chamber when in one
Need to identify whether user is in an echo chamber, and what topic(s) the echo chamber consists of
Then attempt to like only posts that are not in the echo chamber to see movement.
